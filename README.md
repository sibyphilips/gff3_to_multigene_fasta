# gff_to_multigene_fasta
a script to make a multigene fasta file from a mitogenome fasta file and gff file from the GenBank
If we have a .gff file and a fasta file in a folder, we can make a multigene fasta file from these two files.

Often it is essential to get separate gene alignments for phylogenetics, and it is quite possible that we are using a mitogenomic dataset. Some species' data will be available only as a complete mitogenome file in the GenBank. This script reads a complete mitogenome file and make a multigene fasta file for you.

Please open the file to see the code.
